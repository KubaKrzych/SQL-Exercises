# SQL-Exercises
This repository is a container for my SQL queries that I have written as to learn SQL by completing some exercises written in Polish. I have written those at the second semester of learning at Warsaw University of Technology at database classes. Obviously, all the names are completely made up.

Based on the name of the file, you can tell what problem does it solve.
